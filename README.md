Database Configuration
 The application uses an H2 in-memory database by default. To use a different database:
  1. Update the application.properties file
  2. Add the appropriate database driver dependency in pom.xml
  3. Configure the database connection details

Customization
   * Modify the application.properties file to change server port, database settings, etc.
   * Add new fields to the Employee or Department models as needed
   * Extend the service layer to add custom business logic
   * Customize the UI by modifying the Thymeleaf templates in src/main/resources/templates/

Future Enhancements
   * User authentication and authorization
   * File upload for employee photos
   * Pagination for large employee lists
   * Export functionality (PDF/Excel reports)
   * Email notifications
   * REST API endpoints
   * Advanced reporting and analytics

Troubleshooting
   * If the application fails to start, check that Java 17+ is installed
   * If you can't access the H2 console, ensure spring.h2.console.enabled=true is set
   * For port conflicts, change the server port in application.properties

Support
   * For issues or questions, please check the documentation or create an issue in the project repository.
