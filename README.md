Database Configuration
The application uses an H2 in-memory database by default. To use a different database:

Update the application.properties file

Add the appropriate database driver dependency in pom.xml

Configure the database connection details

Example for MySQL:

properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employeedb
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
Customization
Modify the application.properties file to change server port, database settings, etc.

Add new fields to the Employee or Department models as needed

Extend the service layer to add custom business logic

Customize the UI by modifying the Thymeleaf templates in src/main/resources/templates/

Future Enhancements
User authentication and authorization

File upload for employee photos

Pagination for large employee lists

Export functionality (PDF/Excel reports)

Email notifications

REST API endpoints

Advanced reporting and analytics

Troubleshooting
If the application fails to start, check that Java 17+ is installed

If you can't access the H2 console, ensure spring.h2.console.enabled=true is set

For port conflicts, change the server port in application.properties
